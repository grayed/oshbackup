The oshbackup is a backup suite intended for easy integration with any
modern Unix-like OS. It aims at management simplicity and reusing of
the software already bundled with OS.

The project is far from being complete, see TODO.

Currently there are two scripts:

* dumpfs - To be run on machine whose filesystems are being backed up.
  This script starts dump(8) and pushes it via ssh(1) to backup host.

* rotate_fs_dumps - To be run on backup host periodically (or right
  after backup). This script removes extra dumps being held, unless
  dumps counts of each level go below the specified limit.
